# ðŸŽ„ Christmas Giftlist Manager

## Overview
The **Christmas Giftlist Manager** is a Java-based system designed to manage holiday gift lists efficiently. Given a text file containing a list of people and their gift status, the system categorizes individuals into either a "Nice" or "Naughty" list. This project emphasizes the use of custom-built data structures and showcases the implementation of advanced list management techniques.

## Features and Functionalities

### Custom Data Structures: Nice List & Naughty List
Created a custom **Nice List** data structure to store individuals who have a gift next to their name. Those without gifts are placed in a **Naughty List**, showcasing efficient categorization and management.

### Linked List and Array List Interfaces
Designed separate interfaces for managing lists using both linked lists and array lists. This demonstrates versatility in handling data, offering different implementations based on performance needs.

### Linked Sorted List Interface
Developed a **Linked Sorted List** interface to maintain the order of individuals as they are processed, ensuring that names are efficiently sorted and stored in the appropriate lists.

### Text File Input and Processing
The program reads a text file as input, automatically parsing and sorting individuals into either the Nice or Naughty list based on their gift status.

## Methodology

### Data Structure Design
Custom implementations of linked lists, array lists, and a sorted linked list were used to handle the storage and organization of the gift lists. This provides an efficient and scalable solution for categorizing and managing data.

### File Parsing and List Sorting
Developed a system to read and parse the input text file, handling large lists of individuals. The sorting logic ensures that names are properly classified and organized in the correct lists based on their gift status.

## Purpose
The **Christmas Giftlist Manager** project is designed to offer a practical application of data structures in a festive context. It showcases how to efficiently manage and sort data using custom-built structures, making it a strong demonstration of core Java skills in handling real-world problems.
